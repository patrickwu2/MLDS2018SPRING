# 2-1 Visualize the optimization process

In this experiment, we will use dimension reduction method to visualize how parameters change during training process.

Some files in this directory:

1. code:
	- `hw1-2-1.sh`: execute `hw1-2-1.py` for 8 times
	- `hw1-2-1.py`: DNN code training on MINST (which will output `.csv` file including accuracy and parameters)
	- `1-2-1_visualize.py`: use PCA to achieve dimension reduction
2. png file: outcome file

3. Noted that we havn't push any `.csv` file on this repo for it is too large

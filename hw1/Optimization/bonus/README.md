# 2-4 Visualize Error Surface

In this experiment, we are dedicated to visualizing the error surface. In the following, we train the machine to fit a function, randomizing to find points and use tsne to achieve dimension reduction.

There are some files in this directories:

1. code: 
	- `1-2-bonus.py`: training process (which will output `bonus_params`, `bonus_loss`, `bonus_colors` three `.npy` file)
	- `bonus_visualize.py`: load in some `.npy` file and plot the outcome picture
2. `.npy` files: told before
3. `model1-2bonus/`: checkpoint
4. png file: outcome, including 2D and 3D picture

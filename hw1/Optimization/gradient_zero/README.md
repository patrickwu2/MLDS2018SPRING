# 2-3 What happens when gradient is almost zero?

In this experiment, we are trying to figure out what happens when gradient is almost zero. In this time, we will use Hessian Matrix to calculate minimum ratio and plot a figure to show the relationship between minimum ratio and loss.

There are sone files in this directories:
1. codes:
	- `1-2-3.py`: training process (training to fit a function) and record loss and minimum ratio in `1-2-3recorder` (`.npy` file)
	- `visualize.py`: load in `.npy` file and generate picture
2. `.npy` files: told before
2. png file: the outcome

1-1-1: simulate a function.
two funciton can be seen on the top of file "hw1-1.py"
choose one of the three model in the middle of hw1-1.py
* choose_model = 1 : 1layer
* choose_model = 2 : 3layer
* choose_model = 3 : 5layer

Weierstrass function:
* the error rate can be seen in 1-1-1-1/err_summary.py
* the result line can be seen in 1-1-1-1/summary2.py
sin(x) + cos(x^2)
* the error rate can be seen in 1-1-1-2/err_summary.py
* the result line can be seen in 1-1-1-2/summary2.py


1-1-2: train in actual task.

# 3-1 Can network fit random labels?

In this experiment, we will try to fit random labels and use this to observe the generalization of a network.

There are some files in this directories:
1. code:
	- `hw1-3-1.py`: training process (which will record loss and accuracy in two `.csv` file)
	- `models.py` : useful model library
	- `err_summary.py` : read `.csv` file and plot the figure
2. `.csv` file: told above
3. `fake_model/` and `true_model/` : checkpoints
4. png file : the outcome picture

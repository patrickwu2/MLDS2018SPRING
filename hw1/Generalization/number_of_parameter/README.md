# 3-2 Number of parameters v.s. Generalization

In this experiment, we will find whether the # of parameters effects the ability of network generalization.

There are some files in this directories:
1. code: 
	- `1-3-2.py` : training process (which will record # of parameters, loss and accuracy in thos `.csv` file)
	- `models_132.py` : useful model library
	- `visual1-3-2.py` : read those `.csv` file and plot the outcome figure
2. `.csv` files : told above
3. png file : the outcome
